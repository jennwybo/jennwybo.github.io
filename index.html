                <span class="hugeLetter">W</span>ith western states and entire countries going through a record breaking heat and drought, water is more precious now than ever before. It is a requirement for all life on earth, and the minerals in fresh water sources affect our health. With the constant threat of American industrialism, big businesses continue to dump toxic waste into bodies of water that serve as fresh drinking water and places of recreation for the public, but with the slew of toxic waste being dumped into local water sources, should residents start questioning the safety of their water?

              The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) database collects the total annual toxic chemical release to each receiving surface body of water in the United States. Looking at New York State only, lead, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and copper were the three most frequent toxic chemicals reported between the years 2000 and 2021.

            <p class="paragraph">The data shows that of these chemicals, three of them are recognized as carcinogens: lead components, nickel, and polycyclic aromatic compounds. Lead typically enters our water system through pipe corrosion and inadequate water treatment, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Leading scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention agree that there is no safe level of exposure,” the website writes. Lead resembles the mineral calcium, and may be ingested in place of that. Lead poisoning is another threat to the health of the public because it can cause a wide variety of harmful symptoms.

        <p class= "paragraph">
              Nickel is a mineral necessary to many organisms’ diets, but it becomes carcinogenic and toxic in high concentrations. Similar to lead, nickel is used for plating and can leach into the water supply.

            <p class="paragraph">Polycyclic aromatic compounds are on the rise, and are typically derived from “fuels and incomplete combustion processes,” according to an article published to the National Library of Medicine. The Illinois Department of Public Health writes that “ health effects may include cataracts, kidney and liver damage, and jaundice. Repeated skin contact to naphthalene can result in redness and inflammation of the skin. Breathing or swallowing large amounts of naphthalene can cause the breakdown of red blood cells.”

        <p class= "paragraph">When counties are compared, Erie county has the highest amount of annual toxic chemical release to each receiving surface body of water between the years of 2000-2021. Erie county borders Lake Erie, the smallest of the Great Lakes, and the Niagara and Buffalo Rivers run through the entire county. This jarring information makes locals wonder why Erie county has the most heavily polluted water sources?

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">Monroe County, home to Rochester and Niagara County, home to Niagara Falls, are the second and fourth, respectively, most polluted counties  in New York State. All three counties border the Great Lakes, which could indicate a correlation between proximity to the Great Lakes, and the toxicity of the system as a whole. There are several possible causes for the excess release of toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes.
            </p>
        </section>

        <p class= "paragraph">It should also be taken into consideration the high rates of poverty in the cities that reside in these counties. This might be a stronger argument because the third more polluted county in New York State is Onondaga County, which contains the city of Syracuse. Further investigation and information would be required before either causes can be accepter
